# Privacy

## Overview

The Internet is a better place when we respect each other's privacy.
We're personally fans of NoScript, uBlock Origin, and other Internet privacy tools.
To that end, getlocalcert tries to store minimal data on our users.
Here's how.

## Scope

This policy applies to the following websites:

* console.getlocalcert.net (the Console)
* docs.getlocalcert.net (the Docs)
* www.getlocalcert.net (the Marketing Site)

Collectively, referred to as the Service.

## Consent

By using our website, you hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.

If you do not consent, or would like to revoke your consent, stop using the Service.
Please contact us (see below) and we'll delete your account and your personal data.

## Collected information

We collect certain information that can impact your privacy.
Such collection helps us:

* Maintain and operate the Service
* Develop and improve the Service
* Understand and analyze how the Service is used
* Prevent fraud, illegal activity, or terms of service violations

### Web logs

The Console collects standard web server logs containing information from the HTTP request.
Notably, this includes:

* Internet Protocol (IP) address

This information is currently stored indefinitely, although a retention limit is planned.
We'd like to do better here.

The Marketing Site and the Docs do not collect web logs (see GoatCounter below).

### Login with GitHub

If you login with GitHub, the following additional information is collected:

* GitHub username

This information is used to facilitate log in and is stored as long as the account is active.

## Cookies

The Docs and Marketing Site do not use cookies.

The Console uses cookies for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens and session tokens.

The cookies we use are required to provide service.
You may notice that we don't have a cookie banner; we don't use tracking, analytic, or other non-essential cookies.

## Service providers

Our service providers may collect information, please review their privacy policies.

We use the following service providers:

* [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) - Servers for the Console
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Static file hosting for the Docs and the Marketing Site
* [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) - A great, privacy friendly analytics tool
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - Login with GitHub
* [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) - A content distribution network (CDN) we use for CSS files

## GoatCounter

The Docs and Marketing Site use GoatCounter to track page views.
Please review the [GoatCounter docs](https://github.com/arp242/goatcounter/blob/master/docs/sessions.markdown) to see the collected information.

## Information from children

getlocalcert doesn't knowingly collect or store any personal information from children.
We hereby advise children not to provide us such information.
We can remove such information, should it be collected inadvertently, upon request from a guardian.

## Policy updates

This policy may be updated from time to time.
Please review this page periodically.
Updates are effective immediately.

## GDPR and other rights

We applaud the efforts by legislators to protect user data.
If you would like to exercise rights under such law, such as access, rectification, erasure, restriction, or data portability, please contact us.
We hope that the Service's design and policies reduce the need for such requests, but are eager to protect you and your data should we fall short.

## Contact

If you have any questions, please [https://docs.getlocalcert.net/contact/](let us know).
