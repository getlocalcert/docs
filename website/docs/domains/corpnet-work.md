# .corpnet.work

!!! warning "Unreleased"
    
    This feature has not been released yet.

`.corpnet.work` is designed for corporate networks.

Corporate networks often use the `.corp` top-level domain, even though this top-level domain hasn't been formally assigned this purpose.
Unfortunately, since `.corp` is not a valid top-level domain, Certificate Authorities cannot sign certificates under this top-level domain.

Domains under `.corpnet.work` are valid domain names and Certificate Authorities can sign certificates for these domain names.

## Naming

Registrants must show that their selected domain name correlates to their organization in some way.
For example, Google Inc. may register the domain `google.corpnet.work`.
