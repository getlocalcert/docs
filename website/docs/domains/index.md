# Available domains

## Bring your own

If you already own a domain name you can always create another subdomain for your private network.
`internal.example.com` is a popular naming system.
Use [bring-your-own](./bring-your-own-domain/) to get started.


## Free

If you're looking for a free domain name then you should select either [localcert.net](./localcert-net/) or [localhostcert.net](./localhostcert-net/).
The main difference is that `localhostcert.net` always serves an `A` record for `127.0.0.1`.
This makes it easiest to use for locally testing software that needs a valid TLS certificate.
All our domains support [split-view DNS](/dns/split-view/), so you can locally manage routing for your domain.

## Premium

[corpnet.work](./corpnet-work/) is for our premium domain names; suitable for larger environments, such as businesses.
