# Choosing a certificate authority

To issue a certificate you'll need to request one from a Certificate Authority (CA).
getlocalcert.net has been tested with two CAs, [ZeroSSL](./zerossl/) and [Let's Encrypt](./letsencrypt/), however it should be compatible with any CA that supports the ACME DNS-01 protocol.

If you're unsure, try [Let's Encrypt](./letsencrypt/).
